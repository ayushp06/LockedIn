## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted here with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or your data:
- **Email**: [apandejee006@yahoo.com]
- **GitHub**: [github.com/ayushp06]

## Permissions Justification

### Why We Need Each Permission:

- **tabs**: To detect which websites you're actively using for work time tracking
- **storage**: To save your settings and work sites list locally
- **activeTab**: To identify the current website for tracking
- **identity**: For Google OAuth authentication
- **idle**: To detect when you're away from your computer
- **optional_host_permissions (*://*/*)**: LockedIn only requests access to websites after you explicitly add them to your “work sites” list. The extension does not access or collect data from any other sites by default.

## Data Security

We implement security measures including:
- Secure HTTPS connections
- Firebase security rules
- Token-based authentication
- Regular security audits
- No storage of sensitive credentials

## Transparency
- LockedIn does not collect browsing history, cookies, or any content from the pages you visit.  
- The extension only records time spent on user-designated domains for productivity tracking purposes.

## Your Consent

By using LockedIn, you consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.
